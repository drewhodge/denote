* Catholic Church on Marriage

Rev Fr. TImothy Radcliffe OP

The Catholic Church does not oppose gay marriage. It considers it to be
impossible... Marriage is founded on the glorious fact of sexual difference and
its potential fertility. Without this, there would be no life on this planet, no
evolution, no human beings, no future. Marriage takes all sorts of forms, from
the alliance of clans through bride exchange to modern romantic love. We have
come to see that it implies the equal love and dignity of man and woman. But
everywhere and always, it remains founded on the union in difference of male and
female. Through ceremonies and sacrament this is given a deeper meaning, which
for Christians includes the union of God and humanity in Christ.
