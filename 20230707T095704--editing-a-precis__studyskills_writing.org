* Writing a précis

A good précis has to be short and straight to the point.

The foolowing points are the  key characteristics of this type of writing:

  - A précis is a short summary, yet not a paraphrased copy of the original
    piece.
  - The text should be concise, precise, and clear.
  - A précis should be written in your own words, but it can use some quotes
    from the original piece (though not too many, only those that bring real
    value).
  - It should not reflect personal opinion.
  - It should convey only the most important information and omit secondary
    ideas.
  - The key points should be covered as comprehensively as possible.
  - The information in a précis should be conveyed in a logical sequence, with
    clear connections between all parts of the text.
  - It should not contain any details from other sources.
  - A précis should not include any irrelevant or secondary details.
  - A précis is always written in the third person, so the use of first person
    pronouns is not appropriate.

There is another form of précis called a rhetorical précis. The essence of the
two types of précis are similar, but a rhetorical précis is usually much
shorter. A rhetorical précis requires one to summarize core ideas from the
original piece, but it must blend this summary with a brief analysis of how the
author has conveyed his/her ideas.

A rehetorical précis should be only four or five sentences.
