Thnking needs writing. Good writing requires good thinking. Good writing, like
good thinking and good reading, requires time. *Schedule time to write.*

** Reading

*** Types of reading

  1. Elementary reading
     Reading to entertain.
  2. Inspectional reading
     Reading to inform.
     Superficial reading, skimming, getting the 'gist' of the text.
  3. Analytical reading
     Reading to undestand.
     The real workhouse of reading.
  4. Synoptical reading
     Reading various texts on the same topic; finding and
     evaluating contradictions; forming an opinion.

The mediaeval /trivium/ divided learning into three stages: grammar, logic, and
rhetoric.

  - *Grammar*: the first stage of learning, the building blocks, or foundation of
    an academinc subject or topic. Reading types 1 and 2 belong to this stage of
    learning.
  - *Logic*: the second stage of learning involves critial thinking. This is the
    dialectic stage, which exercises alaytical skills, and makes connections
    between cause and effect, historical events, scientific phenomena, and words
    and their meanings. Reading type 3 belongs to this stage.
  - *Rhetoric*: the third stage of learning. In this stage, learners evaluate what
    they have read and learnt and express their own opinions. Reading type 4
    belongs to this stage.

This pattern applies to all study, research, and learning of any kind:

  - Learn facts
  - Analyze the facts
  - Express your own opinions about the facts
