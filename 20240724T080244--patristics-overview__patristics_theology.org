* Patristics/Patrology -- overview

The patristic period ran from the end of the New Testament to the beginning of
the Middle Ages, that is, late in the first century to about the middle of the
eighth century. During this period the church fathers laid the foundations of
Christianity: rules, creeds, and the sacraments were established, in fact, every
aspect of Christian belief, life, and practice was laid down.
