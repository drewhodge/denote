* Dominican reading plans

From: [[https://www.friarly.com/study.html][Studying as a friar]].

A Dominican is always seeking to understand and to grow in knowledge and love of
God. As St. Josemaria Escriva says: “An hour of study, for a modern apostle, is
an hour of prayer.”

What is a Reading Plan?

It is reading with a direction in mind. You do not just read a book and then
another book, in other words, but you read a group of related books, for an
intended end/goal, over a designated period of time.

Three books worth your time for considering how to read like a friar:

  - Josef Pieper’s /Leisure, the Basis of Culture/
  - Antonin Sertillanges’ /The Intellectual Life/
  - Mortimer Adler’s /How to Read a Book/
